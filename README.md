Laser Cutter
============
The Laser Cutter is a little machine that can print/cut patterns on paper,
plastic or wooden materials.

This program is consisted of PC part (implemented in Java)
as a control panel and image processor,
and Arduino part (implemented in Arduino C) as a direct hardware controller.
It works together with our particular Laser Cutter.

This project is developed in collaboration with **Haoyu Zhang**.
Thanks to his analogue electronic talent and circuit adjustment skills,
we were able to see this achievement.
